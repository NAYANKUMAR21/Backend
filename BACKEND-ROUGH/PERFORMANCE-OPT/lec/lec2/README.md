# What is Menorization?

- Menorization is a speed optimization technique in programming, where given a function, you return a cached version of the output if the same inputes are used.
- A Memorized function remembers the results of an output for a given t of inputs.
- In React we can memorize

  - component.
  - function.
  - or just a regular component value/variable.

- By Default React does a Shallow comparision of variables/props/functions, if react sees that a reference to a variable has been changed, react will re-render that element.

## Component Memorization

When we memorize a Component, we have to make sure that we avoid the shallow comparision.

- `Note`: Memorization is not free, we trade for Space to save time.
